# Domain Adaptation with Asymmetrically-Relaxed Distribution Alignment

This codebase implements the method from [Domain Adaptation with Asymmetrically-Relaxed Distribution Alignment.](http://proceedings.mlr.press/v97/wu19f.html).

This codebase is a re-implementation and was not the one used for generating the experiment results in the paper.

Please refer to `scripts/*.sh` for running experiments on a toy example and handwritten digit datasets.

The code works with Python>=3.6 and PyTorch>=1.0.
